Forensicability feature extraction includes both image quality features x_q and forensicability features x_f, resulting in corresponding image quality scores y_q and forensicability scores y_f.

Based on the image quality scores y_q and forensicability scores y_f, determine the category e_c.

Organize the data into a CSV file at Forensicability_Quantification/data/train.csv, where the first 222 dimensions represent x_q, followed by x_f.
